## Analysis Overview
The primary goal of this analysis was to explore the distribution of calories among different BurgerKing products, identify any potential trends or patterns, and gain insights into the calorie content across various categories of products.

## Key Steps

Data Loading and Exploration: The dataset was loaded into R, and initial exploratory analysis was conducted to understand its structure and content.

Data Cleaning: Cleaning steps were performed to handle missing or inconsistent data, ensuring that the dataset was ready for analysis.

Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles were calculated to provide a summary of the calorie distribution.

Data Visualization: Various plots and charts were created using R's visualization libraries to visually represent the distribution of calories. Histograms, box plots, and bar plots were used to showcase the data.

Category-wise Analysis: The products were grouped by category, and analyses were performed to compare the calorie content across different categories.

Hypothesis Testing: Hypothesis tests (e.g., t-tests or ANOVA) were conducted to determine if there were significant differences in calorie counts between specific categories.
